    "HDBSCAN, or Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, was an ideal model for clustering this data at a high level for a few reasons. First, unlike say, KMeans, HDBSCAN makes very few assumptions about the underlying nature of the data, only that it contains \"noise\"--a very critical assumption for Twitter data, which is understood to be inherently very noisy--and some dense regions in the data space, aka \"clusters.\" Additionally, unlike its close relative, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN requires very little parameter tuning - basically just specification of `min_samples`, the number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered a core point, and `min_cluster size` which is the smallest size grouping that can be considered a cluster. `min_cluster size=100`  is a very conservative size for a 240,000+ row data set and `min_samples=15` is set to avoid classifying too much of the data as noise.

    "With the current parameters, HDBSCAN regards 92.7% of the tweets as noise. This is not an unexpected result given HDBSCAN's emphasis on hiearchical density. Note that in a previous iteration with `min_samples=45`, HDBSCAN returned 18 clusters and 94% of tweets were unclassified. However, given my rigorous filtering in my Twitter search query, I'm not prepared to conclude that in this particular dataset, all of these unclassified tweets are really noise. Therefore, after I add these cluster labels to the dataframe, I will isolate the tweets that were not classified before delving into label interpretation so then I can explore clustering the unclassified tweets in a later notebook."
